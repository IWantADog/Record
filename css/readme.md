# css 技巧备忘录

## 伪类(pseudo class)

[MDN Introduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)

A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s).(通过伪类可以对选中的对象指定一个样式)

> __Pseudo-classes let you apply a style to an element not only in relation to the content of the document tree__, but also in relation to external factors like the history of the navigator (`:visited`, for example), the status of its content (like `:checked` on certain form elements), or the position of the mouse (like `:hover`, which lets you know if the mouse is over an element or not).
