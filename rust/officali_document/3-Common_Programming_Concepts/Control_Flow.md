# Control Flow

## `if` Expressions

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
```

It’s also worth noting that the condition in this code __must be a bool__. If the condition isn’t a bool, we’ll get an error.

### Handling Multiple Conditions with else `if`

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}
```

### Using `if` in a `let` Statement

```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

    println!("The value of number is: {}", number);
}
```

This means the values that have the potential to be results from each arm of the `if` must be the __same type__.

> Rust wouldn’t be able to do that if the type of number was only determined at runtime; the compiler would be more complex and would make fewer guarantees about the code if it had to keep track of multiple hypothetical types for any variable.

## Repetition with Loops

Rust has three kinds of loops: `loop`, `while`, and `for`.

### Repeating Code with loop

The `loop` keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop.

You can place the `break` keyword within the loop to tell the program when to stop executing the loop.

### Returning Values from Loops

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!("The result is {}", result);
}
```

### Conditional Loops with `while`

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0 {
        println!("{}!", number);

        number -= 1;
    }

    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

### Looping Through a Collection with `for`

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a.iter() {
        println!("the value is: {}", element);
    }
}
```
